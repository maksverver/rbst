 * RbstSet should have constant-time begin()!

 * Maybe: implement single-pass insertion (should be slightly faster)

 * Maybe: support random-access operations (like operator[] and at()) on
   RbstSet object?

 * Add support for C++11 and C++14 features.
   (Conditional using preprocessor directives.)

 * Check test coverage!  (How?)
